# Welcome to Phoenix!

Phoenix is a modern open-source and free code editor for the web, built for the browser. - under construction.

## Building Phoenix
* Require widows for builds in the port window
* Have brackets installed in windows
* use nodejs version for windows less than node v6.10
* run `npm install --force`
* run tools/setup_for_hacking.bat
* click on brackets to open the debug builds

## Acknowledgements
* Phoenix is based on the Brackets code editor by Adobe. Find out more on [Adobe Brackets here](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/).
* Inspired by previous work from the [Mozilla Thimble](https://github.com/mozilla/thimble.mozilla.org) project to port brackets to the web. https://github.com/mozilla/brackets
